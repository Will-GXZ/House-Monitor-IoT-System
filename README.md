## Introduction
This project is basically a web application that can communicate with sensor networks using CoAP (a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks in the Internet of Things). It can collect environmental data from sensors, and also serve as a web server such that it can display the data in the user's browser.

## Technology Stack
* Spring Core
* Spring MVC
* Java EE
* HTML, CSS
* JavaScript
* Californium (Cf) CoAP framework
* ipv6
* 6LoPan
* Linux
* Contiki
* Git
